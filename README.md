# Multipler Copier/Paster
This program will use the computer’s clipboard (And manipulate it) so that when the user presses Ctrl+C/Ctrl+X (Or whatever buttons would copy/cut something), it checks if it’s an image, text, or something else, and then will place these into queues of those types, allowing you to even copy several items at a time for later usage. Then when pasting (Or Ctrl+V), you just select which of the three types you’re pasting from the clipboard, and then it’ll just paste whichever one is currently next in the queue.
